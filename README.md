# About Project:
This is a microblog that mirrors the basic functionalities of creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts as seen in Quora and Reddit. 

# Project Scope:
This project mainly covers the backend project and the underlying design principles on which large scale Flask applications function.

# Design Concept and Approach:
No particular design approach was used. I mainly used this to practice and understand how large-scale applications use the GET and POST request for data transfer

# Target Audience and User Experience (UX):
The intended target audience are tech-savvy individuals who enjoy using the internet to read news and stay updated

# Responsive Design and Mobile Optimization:
This microblog is responsive and fairly accomodates different screen sizes with the use of BootStrap which is framework designed to help developers build and ship faster.

# Technologies and Tools Used:
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript
* Flask
* Python

# Challenges and Solutions:
The main challenge faces in the inability to seamlessly integrate dynamic pages even though I achieved routing and requests. Also, hosting was a bit challenging as it was difficult navigating the cloud environment as I intended to use AWS not Heroku, Netlify. 

# Conclusion and Key Takeaways:
* Routing is an important concept needed to master
* Reading documentation is essential and easy for debugging, especially when videos are not that great
* Mastering GET and POST request is essential to interacting with APIs
* SQLachemy is a cool Database framework and library for pre-production not production as caching in the same file might expose application to cyber attacks
* Learning is fun
